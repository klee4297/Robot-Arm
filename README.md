# Robot-Arm

This code creates a Robot arm that has a base with two wheels, and three arms with seperate joints and a gripper.

In the main function:
we have 2 rectangles X, X1. X being the size for the base and arms. X1 being the size for the gripper.

text1~text5 are explanation for what key does what.

In the loop function:
1. I assigned keys for each joint movement, and spacebar movement. for the spacebar movement I made the grippers to move when pressing the spacebar and go back to its original position when let go.
2. I drew the base and arms and made the position to change when keys are pressed.
3. I drew two circles for the wheels.
